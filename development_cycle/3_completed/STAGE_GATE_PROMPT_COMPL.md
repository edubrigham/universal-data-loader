Context: A feature folder has been moved into the completed stage. 
The folder is referenced in this chat.

Instructions:

Review the Feature: Read and synthesise the content within the referenced 
folder — including README.md, spec.md, design.md, and any 
implementation_notes.md — to gain a clear understanding of what was delivered,
how it works, and what outcomes it achieves.

Generate Completion Summary: Write a concise 1–3 paragraph summary describing:

- The purpose of the feature
- What was built / modified
- Any notable design decisions or functional results

Create summary.md: Save the summary into the same folder as a new file titled 
summary.md.

Log the Completion: Create a single-line log entry for inclusion in the 
organisation-wide completed_features_log.md:

Format:
- **[Feature Name]:** Completed [YYYY-MM-DD]. 
[One-sentence summary of purpose/outcome].

Update Application Documentation: 
- Identify the official application documentation files (e.g., under 
  `application documentation/`, relevant module `README.md` files) affected 
  by this feature.
- Propose specific, concrete edits to these files to reflect the implemented 
  feature (e.g., update process descriptions, add configuration details, 
  mention new outputs/behaviors, correct inaccuracies based on final 
  implementation).
- Apply the necessary documentation updates using the appropriate tool.

Output:

- Provide the content of the generated summary.md.
- Provide the exact log entry to append to 
  development_cycle/_reference/completed_features_log.md.
- State which documentation files were updated and summarize the changes made.

Note
Once you've completed this, continue by assisting with any final checks, 
rollout tasks, or moving to the next feature. This process may involve 
multiple steps and tool calls.
